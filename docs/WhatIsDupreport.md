# What is dupReport?

dupReport is a program that will collect up status emails from Duplicati and combine them into a single email report that is sent to you. The following diagram helps explain how it works:

Some general points about dupReport

- The program is designed for those who run backups from multiple locations and are getting multiple     Duplicati emails per day. For example, we have 14 separate emails coming in per day from Duplicati backup jobs; way too many to keep track of manually. In these cases, dupReport will collect and collate all those emails and create a single report that summarizes all of them. If you only have a single instance of Duplicati running a single backup job, you may get some value from dupReport, but it may be overkill.
- dupReport doesnâ€™t interface directly with Duplicati and doesn't read the Duplicati configuration files, log files, or or database. It connects to your email server, reads the backup report emails that Duplicati sends out, then parses them to create its report. It does not need to be run on the same system where Duplicati is running, it can be on a completely different system if that is more convenient for you. The only requirement is that the system where dupReport is running must be able to connect to your email server.
