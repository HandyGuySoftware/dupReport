## [headings] section

The [headings] section contains the default column titles for the fields used in all the dupReport reports. You can alter the headings to suit your tastes. For example, to change the heading for the “size” column from “Size” to “How Big?”, change this:

```
size = Size
```


to this:

```
size = How Big?
```


Once this change is made, any report that displays the “size” column will display the text “How Big?” as the column header.

To prevent a field from displaying on a report, leave the heading specification blank for that field. For example, to prevent the “added” field from displaying on a report, change its line in the [headings] section to:

```
added =
```
