# Report Formats

dupReport has several formats for reporting that are specified in the “style” parameter in the [report] section of the dupReport.rc file. Each report can be sorted in various ways. Sorting options are configured using the “sortby” option in the [report] section.

**The ‘srcdest’ report**, also known as the “classic” report, displays backup jobs in groups of Source-Destination pairs. Here is an example of the ‘srcdest’ report:
