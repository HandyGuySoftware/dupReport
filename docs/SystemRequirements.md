# System Requirements

dupReport has been formally tested on Linux (Debian 8 and 9) and Windows 10 and is officially supported on those platforms. However, users posting on the [dupReport announcement page on the Duplicati Forum](https://forum.duplicati.com/t/announcing-dupreport-a-duplicati-email-report-summary-generator/1116)   have stated theyâ€™ve installed and run the program on a wide variety of operating systems. The python code uses standard Python 3 libraries, so it *should* run on any platform where Python 3 can be run.

In addition to the dupReport program files, the only other software dupReport needs is Python3. Installation instructions for Python are beyond our scope here, but instructions are easily searchable on the Internet.
